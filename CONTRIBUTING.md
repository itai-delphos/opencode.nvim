## Contributing to `opencode.nvim`

Thank you for wanting to contribute!

## Guidelines

- **Align with project vision**
  - _Integrate_ Neovim with `opencode`'s TUI — not _re-implement_ the TUI in Neovim.
  - Simple, intuitive UX.
  - If unsure, propose changes in an issue or discussion first.
- **Add more value than maintenance burden**
  - Prefer simple, robust solutions.
  - Consider edge cases and existing project patterns.
  - Functionality should be widely useful.
- **High-quality Pull Requests**
  - Fill out the PR template.
  - Review any AI-generated code yourself.
  - Address any automated PR comments (some are inaccurate, I know).

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive. See the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
